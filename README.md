Hi, I'm Thomas 👋

Fullstack developer from Graz, Austria, with 4 years of building cross-platform apps in Flutter & Dart. Lately I've been diving deep into system architecture, scaling, and playing around with LLMs – but I still love crafting beautiful UIs that just feel right.

**[📄 Check out my full CV](cv.md)**

Currently splitting my time between:
- Building cool stuff at **IMENDO** (C#, .NET, React)
- Leading technical decisions at **LegalSuite** (PostgreSQL, OpenSearch, CI/CD)

What I bring to the table:
- Building dev tools & packages that other devs actually enjoy using
- Turning complex problems into simple solutions
- Creating slick, intuitive user experiences across all platforms
- Leading product development from "wouldn't it be cool if..." to production

My toolbox:
- **Core:** Flutter, Dart (it's my happy place)
- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript
- **Backend:** Python, Java, .NET, Node.js, bun
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, OpenSearch
- **Cool stuff:** Rive2D, Figma, blockchain/Web3
- **Emerging:** LLMs, system architecture

I'm especially passionate about the Web3 space and building tools that push boundaries.
